#### A girl appeared in the girls bathroom. Her dark hair swaying behnind her.(???????)She went up bodly to the third bathroom stall, and knocked on the door three times., before saying,"Hanako-san, Hanako-san, are you there?"
#### There was a break of silence for a while, before the door creaked open slightly and a boys's voice whispered erieerkly,"Here~..." The door swung open fully and no one was there.
#### She sighed heavily and impatiently said,"Come out, now. Don't bother trying to scare me, Hanako... kun?" Again, there was no reponse. She cratched her head and announced her leave before heading for the door. She gripped the door handle and was about to leave when the same voice shouted frantically,"WAIT!! I'm sorry, haha! Please come back and tell me your wish..."
#### The girl turned around and stared at the supposed to be Hanako-san. "A boy..." she muttered to herself.
#### "Yes, I am a male. Hanako-san of the toilet. Nice to meet you~" He hovered in the air before sitting down on the top of the toilet in one of the stalls, looking all cool like. "I suppose you know what I do right?..." 
#### "Yea. You grant a wish for a price, don't you? I... I am Rina... Izanami Rina... My grade has nothing to do with my wish." she began. "so.... your wish is?" he asked curiously. "Falling in lobve with a boy? Good grades? Money? Free Food-"
#### "Kill me."
#### ............. "Excuse me?" He got off the toilet and approached her, trying to get a clearer response before he did antything else.
#### "I said kill me, Hanako. Is my wish that hard to understand?" she folded her arms calmly.
#### In the bathroom stall of the highschool which Hanako resides in, he faced hesitance to agree to a wish for the first time.
